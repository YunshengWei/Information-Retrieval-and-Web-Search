run_dev.sh takes one argument specifing which task you want to run with.
For example, if you want to test your task 2 program with dev set, you should invoke

sh run_dev.sh task2/

The script will output the number of different lines with respect to the correct
solution. A correct implementation should output several lines of 0's.

formatVerification.py takes no arguments. This script verifies that you are printing output
correctly to stdout based off of the toy_example. It does NOT verify that you are printing
the correct output, only the correct output format.
